## Hey there 👋

I'm Aub, a beginner developer from France.

I'm learning a bit of everything right now — web development with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, plus some **Java** and **Rust** as I explore new tools and concepts.

I love experimenting, building small projects, and improving step by step.  
You'll see this profile grow as I upload things I'm working on, tests, ideas, and whatever I create while learning.

I’m also a huge cat lover 😸 — that’s why my profile picture features one!

Feel free to check out my repos, everything here is made by me as I learn.  
See you around!
