## Hey there 👋

I'm Aub, a beginner developer from France.

I'm currently learning web development — **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — and also exploring **Java** and **Rust** as I grow my skills.  
I like experimenting, building simple projects, and learning step by step.

This profile is where I’ll be uploading small experiments, ideas, and things I’m working on as I improve.  
Everything here is made from scratch while I learn, no copy/paste templates.
