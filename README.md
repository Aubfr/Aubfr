## Hey there 👋

I'm Aub, a beginner developer from France.

I'm currently learning web development, python and also exploring **Java** and **Rust** as I grow my skills.  
I like experimenting, building simple projects, and learning step by step.

This profile is where I’ll be uploading small experiments, ideas, and things I’m working on as I improve.  
Everything here is made from scratch while I learn, no copy/paste templates.

## Tools & Tech

- Python
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Java  
- Rust

## A Bit About Me

- Big fan of **Hazbin Hotel**  
- My YouTube link is available on my profile  
- I'm motivated and active, always learning something new

Thanks for stopping by! 🙌
